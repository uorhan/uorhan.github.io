**Cukurova NLP (CuNLP)** is a Natural Language Processing research group operating within the Department of Computer Engineering at Cukurova University.  

Our group focuses primarily on **Turkish NLP**, developing innovative solutions at the intersection of **artificial intelligence** and **linguistics**.

## Current Focus

We are currently working on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, particularly on **hallucination** and **reasoning** problems.  
We welcome **hardworking and motivated students** who are passionate about LLMs and eager to explore these topics.  

Undergraduate and graduate students interested in joining our research are encouraged to apply.  
Prior experience or coursework in **Machine Learning**, **Natural Language Processing**, or related areas will be considered an advantage.  

Collaborations with researchers and groups sharing similar interests are also highly welcome.
