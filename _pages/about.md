About
======
I am an academic researcher specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and the founder of the Cukurova NLP research group. While my background includes clustering, fuzzy logic and biosignal processing, my core research has focused on Natural Language Processing since 2015. Our group currently works on several NLP-based projects.
