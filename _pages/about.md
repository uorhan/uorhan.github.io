## About
I am a researcher exploring the boundaries between artificial and human intelligence, and the founder of the Çukurova NLP Research Group. My earlier studies in clustering, fuzzy logic, and biosignal processing gradually led me to a deeper question: how does language shape thought, and can a machine ever truly understand it? Since 2015, my work has focused on Natural Language Processing — where data meets meaning, and algorithms begin to mirror fragments of human mind.

## Beyond Science
I’ve found a way to bring together my passions for science, art, and imagination — by writing science fiction.  
Below are my published novels, exploring the boundaries between artificial worlds and human consciousness.
