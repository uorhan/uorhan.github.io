### Overview
**Digital Soil Texture Analyzer** was a TÜBİTAK-funded project (2018–2020) focused on developing a **novel intelligent electronic device** capable of analyzing soil texture through **ultrasound penetration** and machine learning methods.

The project combined **hardware innovation** and **artificial intelligence algorithms** to provide a rapid, non-destructive, and accurate method for identifying soil texture components (sand, silt, clay).

---

### Key Achievements
- Designed and prototyped a digital analyzer integrating **ultrasound sensors**, **embedded systems**, and **AI-based prediction models**.  
- Funded **3 graduate students** (1 PhD, 2 MEng) during the project.  
- Produced **multiple scientific and intellectual outputs**, including journal articles, symposium proceedings, and patents.
