### Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) stands at the intersection of linguistics and artificial intelligence, where **morphological and semantic analysis** play central roles.  
For agglutinative languages such as Turkish, **morphological disambiguation** has a critical impact on all subsequent NLP processes. Semantic word networks, on the other hand, represent another major research area.

Among them, **WordNet** has served as a model for constructing semantic networks in many languages. However, expert-based WordNet projects often face difficulties due to the scarcity of qualified annotators. Therefore, **automated detection of semantic relations** has become an increasingly important field.

In this project, we focused on **developing an improved morphological analyzer** and **an automated semantic network for Turkish**.  
Finite-state machines defining Turkish morphosyntactic structure were implemented, complemented by **Viterbi-based disambiguation** and **novel stem discovery** approaches based on recurrence statistics.  

Analysis of the **TDK Contemporary Turkish Dictionary** revealed definitional patterns that enabled us to identify multiple inter-word relations. These relations were then validated and expanded using the **MentionSense architecture**, resulting in a **weighted semantic graph** connecting word meanings rather than mere entries.  

The constructed semantic network was designed to detect and reinforce **synonymy, hypernymy, and antonymy** relations through bidirectional connectivity and edge weighting.  
Finally, a procedure for generating **definition suggestions** for newly discovered or compound lemma candidates was proposed.
