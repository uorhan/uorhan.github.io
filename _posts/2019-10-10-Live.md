Something happened in 2016 - I found myself drawn into the world of **Natural Language Processing**. And not just by curiosity, but through a nationally funded research project. Supported by **TÜBİTAK**, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (Project No. 215E256), our core team at **Çukurova University** set out to answer a deceptively simple question:

> *If a machine is ever to understand Turkish - truly understand it beyond a sequence of letters - shouldn’t it also have its own dictionary?*

But not an ordinary dictionary.  
A **living** one.  
A dictionary that could update itself — a web of words that continuously evolves.

That vision became the foundation of our project, **“The Live Turkish Dictionary Network Design with Weighted Graphs,”** which I led from **April 2016 to April 2019**.  
It was completed on schedule, without delay, but the real story lies in how it reshaped our understanding of language itself.

### From Words to Networks

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** sits at the crossroads of linguistics and artificial intelligence — a field where morphology meets meaning.  
But working with Turkish was far from easy. Unlike English, where morphology is relatively light, Turkish is an **agglutinative language** — each suffix adds a new layer of meaning, blurring the boundary between form and semantics. Finding the true stem of a word can feel like solving a riddle.

We began our journey with these challenges. Our goal was not only to design a **morphological analyzer**, but also to **build an intelligent system capable of automatically discovering semantic relations** among words in the dictionary.

Traditional resources such as *WordNet* had long guided this type of research, yet their manual, expert-based construction was slow and expensive. We dreamed of something more dynamic — a dictionary that could **learn from its own patterns**.

### Designing the Network

At the project’s core was a **finite-state morphological analyzer** tailored for Turkish morphosyntax.  
We implemented **Viterbi-based disambiguation** to reduce uncertainty and proposed a novel **stem discovery algorithm** based on recurrence statistics.

Meanwhile, our system began to study thousands of definitions from the **TDK Contemporary Turkish Dictionary**, gradually recognizing recurring definitional patterns. These patterns revealed hidden links — **synonymy**, **hierarchy**, and **antonymy** — between words.

Using our **MentionSense** architecture, we transformed these findings into a **weighted semantic graph** that connected meanings rather than mere entries.  
Each edge in this network carried a measurable strength, allowing the system to reason about the closeness of concepts.  
In the end, what we built was more than a dictionary — it was a **computational model of how meanings resonate across the Turkish language**.

### What We Learned

Through this network, we discovered that semantic proximity could be quantified using graph-theoretic measures such as **PageRank** and **bidirectional accessibility**.  
This enabled not only the detection of synonym clusters but also the identification of **new lemma candidates**.  
We even devised a procedure to generate **definition suggestions for newly formed or compound words**.

In essence, the project showed that Turkish — with all its morphological depth — can be modeled as a **weighted, dynamic semantic network**.  
It revealed that language is not a static tree with roots and branches, but a **living web that constantly rebalances itself**.
