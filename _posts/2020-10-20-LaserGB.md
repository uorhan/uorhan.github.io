The story, in truth, began while I was searching for new fields to apply the probabilistic classification method I had developed in my doctoral research. One day, a colleague from the Faculty of Agriculture demonstrated the Bouyoucos hydrometer method for soil analysis â€” and in that instant, a spark lit up in my mind. *Why couldnâ€™t this be done through image processing or light-based sensing?* I thought. Yet, as life unfolded with all its distractions and challenges, the idea was quietly shelved in the dusty corners of my mind.

Years later, after joining Ã‡ukurova University, I regained my rhythm and energy. While revisiting those long-forgotten ideas, I came across this one again and said to myself, *why not?* Among several experimental project concepts, it was this that began to take shape first. Our initial experiments were crude and intuitive â€” nothing more than a curious attempt, presented at a small symposium. But when I was joined by a research assistant, things changed. Through long hours and countless trials, an early prototype emerged: a daring experiment **to understand the world through light**.

We called it **Laser-Guided Bouyoucos** â€” a modest yet visionary prototype that demonstrated the feasibility of **laser-based soil texture estimation**, long before artificial intelligence and ultrasound became the norm in analytical systems.  
The premise was simple yet ambitious: instead of relying on human expertise, hydrometers, and prolonged sedimentation observation, we could now use **laser points**, **light-dependent resistors**, and intelligent circuit boards.

Between **2015 and 2017**, we refined the system and began to partially estimate the proportions of sand, silt, and clay in soil samples. Eventually, we encountered certain limitations â€” moments that nudged us toward new approaches. Thus began the transition from optical sensing to other methods, leading us toward the **ultrasonic transducer-based** systems that would later become the foundation of our patented designs.
