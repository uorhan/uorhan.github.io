### Overview
Before the TÃœBÄ°TAK-funded *Digital Soil Texture Analyzer* project (2018â€“2020), an early prototype was developed to test the feasibility of **laser-based soil texture estimation**.  
This system, named **Laser-Guided Bouyoucos**, used **laser diodes** and **LDR (light-dependent resistor)** sensors to measure the soil sedimentation process in a modified Bouyoucos setup.

The experiments successfully demonstrated that **optical attenuation curves** obtained by LDR sensors could be analyzed using **regression and intelligent algorithms** to estimate soil texture components.

### ðŸ§ª System Design
The prototype consisted of:
- A transparent **graduated cylinder** for soil suspension (1 L).  
- A vertical frame holding **laser emitters** and **LDR sensors** aligned at multiple heights.  
- A microcontroller and data acquisition system recording voltage variations during sedimentation.
